# Project Background
Luxury watches represent a unique segment of the global luxury goods industry, characterised by high-end craftsmanship, brand heritage, and exclusivity. The industry is dominated by Swiss watchmakers such as Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, and Omega, along with high-end fashion brands like Cartier. The data set supplies sales for over 160,000 watches. 
This project analyses the dataset in order to uncover insights that will guide decision makers in marketing, product development, and pricing strategy. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Market Trends & Brand Insights** 
- **Pricing Strategy & Premium Models** 
- **Material & Design Preferences** 
- **Brand Positioning & Competitive Differentiation**

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The database consists of a single table, luxury_watch_dataset_cleaned, which contains structured data about luxury watch transactions. Each row represents an individual sale, including details such as brand, model, material composition, pricing, and purchase information.
Below is the finalised table after structuring and cleaning the data.

## Dataset Schema

| Column Name       | Data Type | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Brand**        | TEXT     | The luxury watch manufacturer (e.g., Rolex, Patek Philippe). |
| **Model**        | TEXT     | The specific model of the watch (e.g., Submariner, Daytona). |
| **Reference**    | TEXT     | Unique reference number for the watch model. |
| **Complication** | TEXT     | Type of watch mechanism or special features (e.g., automatic, chronograph). |
| **Case Material** | TEXT     | The material used for the watch case (e.g., steel, platinum, gold). |
| **Bracelet Material** | TEXT | The material of the bracelet (e.g., leather, rubber, steel). |
| **Dial**         | TEXT     | The watch face colour (e.g., black, blue, silver). |
| **Hour Markings** | TEXT     | Type of markings on the dial (e.g., Roman numerals, Arabic numerals). |
| **Lunette Material** | TEXT | Material used for the bezel (e.g., ceramic, steel). |
| **Price**        | INTEGER  | The price of the watch in USD. |

## Initial Data Quality Checks

Below are the key findings and improvements made:
-	Added Transaction_ID â€“ Assigned a unique ID to every sale. (The dataset originally lacked a unique transaction identifier. Since the same Reference number appeared in multiple rows, it was determined that for this analysis it would be best if each row represented an individual sale rather than just a unique watch model.)
-	Checked for Missing Values â€“ Identified 1 missing Reference value and removed it.
-	Ensured Price Is Numeric â€“ Verified no non-numeric values exist.
-	Standardised Categorical Values â€“ Fixed inconsistencies in materials and complications.
-	Simulated Purchase Dates & Locations â€“ Added realistic timestamps and regional purchase data.



# Executive Summary

## Overview of Findings

This analysis explores key trends in luxury watch sales, focusing on seasonality, regional demand, and pricing strategies. Sales peak between August and December, driven by holiday shopping patterns, while February consistently records the lowest sales volume. A decline in sales in 2024 suggests potential economic shifts or changes in consumer behavior.  

Regionally, the USA and Australia lead in total sales, while China and Japan show strong growth potential for luxury watch brands. Rolex dominates the global market, followed by Omega and Audemars Piguet, with premium brands like Patek Philippe commanding the highest prices.  

Material and design choices significantly influence pricing, with Platinum, Rose Gold, and White Gold watches ranking among the most expensive. Black, Blue, and Silver dials are the most popular, reflecting classic consumer preferences. Automatic watches consistently sell at a premium, reinforcing their perception as high-end craftsmanship pieces.

- The **USA and Australia** have the highest luxury watch sales.
- However, **China and Japan** represent strong emerging markets with high demand for premium brands like Rolex and Omega.
- Companies should **tailor pricing, marketing, and distribution strategies** for these key regions.

### 3. Focus on High-Margin Materials
- **Platinum, Rose Gold, and White Gold watches** have the highest average prices.
- Watchmakers can **increase profit margins** by emphasizing these materials in high-end collections.
- **Carbon and Ceramic** watches also show strong pricing potential and should be marketed for **modern, innovative buyers**.

### 4. Optimize Brand Positioning
- **Rolex dominates in both sales volume and pricing power**.
- **Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet** target ultra-luxury buyers with significantly higher average prices.
- **Omega and TAG Heuer** perform well in the mid-tier market but should explore **premium limited-edition collections** to compete in the high-end sector.

### 5. Strategic Product Development
- **Black, Blue, and Silver dials** are the most popular and should be prioritized in mainstream collections.
- **Minimalist watch designs (No Hour Markings) dominate the market**, indicating a strong preference for clean, modern aesthetics.
- **Automatic watches sell at a premium compared to Quartz watches**, reinforcing the importance of **high-quality craftsmanship** in brand messaging.



# Assumptions & Caveats
Throughout the analysis, we made several assumptions and encountered data limitations. These should be considered when interpreting the insights:

### Assumption: Each row represents an individual sale.
- Since the dataset lacked unique transaction IDs, we created a `Transaction_ID` field and treated each row as a separate purchase.
- This assumes that **no duplicate sales entries exist** and that all sales are unique.

### Assumption: Purchase Dates Are Simulated.
- The dataset **did not include actual purchase dates**, so we generated **realistic timestamps** based on market trends.
- Seasonal analysis is **based on these generated dates**, meaning actual seasonality might differ slightly.

### Assumption: Locations Were Generated.
- The dataset **did not include real-world purchase locations**, so we added **realistic country and city assignments**.
- While these locations align with global luxury watch trends, real-world sales **may vary based on distribution channels**.

### Caveat: Price Data Variability.
- Price values were analyzed as provided in the dataset, but we assume **pricing reflects actual market conditions**.
- Some extreme outliers (e.g., ultra-high prices) could result from **limited-edition watches or erroneous data entries**.

### Caveat: Brand Representation in Dataset.
- The dataset may not be **fully representative** of the entire luxury watch industry.
- Some niche brands may be underrepresented, affecting overall **brand comparisons**.
